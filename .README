PROJECT TITLE:
Tracking my Expenses

MY MOTIVATION:
My motivation about creating this app, started on my first week of class, I always have issues keeping my expenses organized and sometimes end up not knowing where the money went, in fact 
I wanted to do this app for my first project but my instructor Arthur Bernier suggested me to wait until I learned React.js to do it.

FRAMEWORK USED:
React.js
Express
MongoDB

CREDITS:
I have to thank Arthur Bernier for his teachings and his support helping me to correct any issues, as well as even suggesting what framework used for my Backend API
I also want to thank Ayla Ex for helping me with my Hooks when I was stuck and confused.
